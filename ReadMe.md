# Freeplane Scripts Edo
Here I want to build a repo from my Freeplane Groovy scripts I've been creating and using over the years.

about Freeplane: https://www.freeplane.org

## about this repo
My idea is to comment as much as possible the scripts so they can be easy to read and play with. I want them to be beginner friendly. I'm no expert as well but I've build some scripts that can be usefull for others.

I'm gonna use subfolders to order and document them.

## spanish and english
My native language is Spanish so most of the actual comments and variable names are in spanish. IÂ´m going to translate them to english over the time (I think I'm going to let the spanish comments as well)

I'm going to write some of the docs in spanish first (easier) and hopefully translate them later.

## Scripts

Script | Description
-------|----------
scriptxx.groovy | description of the script and a link to its [folder](/folder)

## TODO list:

[] create folder with basic information about scripts, freeplane, groovy, etc
[] import scripts one by one
[] other Freeplane Scripts I want to look at in the future:
