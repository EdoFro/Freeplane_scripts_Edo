# Copy node link to clipboard
This little script just copies the "link to a file" from the selected node (if it has any) into the clipboard.

This is usefull if you need to paste the fullpath in another program, for example to paste it into an "Open file" form.

node.link.text is something like this: 
`file:/C:/Users/Edo/Libros/carpeta%20XX/carpeta%20a%20agregar/2020_Book_DigitaleTransformationUndUnter.epub`

and this script returns it like this:

`C:\Users\Edo\Libros\carpeta XX\carpeta a agregar\2020_Book_DigitaleTransformationUndUnter.epub`

more info is commented in the script itself
